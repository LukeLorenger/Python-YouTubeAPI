Notes On YouTube API Project:

Part 1:
	Build service object, gathers statistics from YouTube pages via username refference and using YouTube API
Part 2:
	Calculate the duration of a Playlist, accessing playlist information and ids, using ids to 
	pull data for calculation. This is useful for if youd like the know how long a playlist of tutorials
	might take you. 
Part 3:
	Using python and Youtube API to find the most popular video in the playlist.
	Why: If you go to channels video channel, you can sort all videos from channel by popularity.
	But, a video from 8 years ago is not what you want to listen to as a tech person. 
	You want to find the most popular video in a current playlist

importing libraries
setting up api key using youtube service
regular expressions to calculate total time in video
looping over all videos in playlist
execute that request to api
scroll through and grab video ids
make request to videos resouce using video Ids
loop through responses for all videos in playlist
grab total duration, parce it out, add it up, to get total time for playlist. 
Change script to grab most popular videos
Commented out all lines needed to calculate playlist duration
What is left is code that loops through videos in each playlist
loop over playlist, accessing each video, grabbing view count, creating link for each video
in the playlist.
Add all to list, sort the list based on number of views.
