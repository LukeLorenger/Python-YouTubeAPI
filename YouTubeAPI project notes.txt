Notes On YouTube API Project:

Part 1:
Build service object, gathers statistics from YouTube pages via username reference and using YouTube API
Part 2:
Calculate the duration of a Playlist, accessing playlist information and ids, using ids to pull data for calculation. This is useful if you'd like the know-how long a playlist of tutorials might take you. 
Part 3:
Using python and Youtube API to find the most popular video in the playlist.
Why: If you go to the channels video channel, you can sort all videos from the channel by popularity.
But, a video from 8 years ago is not what you want to listen to as a tech person. 
You want to find the most popular video in a current playlist.

1. Importing Libraries.
2. Setting up API key using youtube service.
3. Regular expressions to calculate total time in the video.
4. Looping over all videos in the playlist.
5. Execute that request to API.
6. Scroll through and grab video ids.
7. Make requests to videos resource using video Ids.
8. Loop through responses for all videos in the playlist.
9. Grab total duration, parce it out, add it up, to get the total time for the playlist. 
10. Change the script to grab the most popular videos.
11. Commented out all lines needed to calculate playlist duration.
12. What is left is code that loops through videos in each playlist.
13. Loop over the playlist, accessing each video, grabbing view count, creating a link for each video in the playlist.
14. Add all to list, sort the list based on the number of views.
